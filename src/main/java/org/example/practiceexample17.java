/*Create a program that prompts for your weight, gender, total alcohol consumed (in ounces), and the amount of time since your last drink.
Calculate your blood alcohol content (BAC) using this formula
where

A is total alcohol consumed, in ounces (oz).
W is body weight in pounds.
r is the alcohol distribution ratio:
0.73 for men
0.66 for women
H is number of hours since the last drink.
Display whether or not itâ€™s legal to drive by comparing the blood alcohol content to 0.08.
